After using DBMS_SCHEDULER to create a job that starts procedures for retrieving mails, it is necessary to make sure that only the latest messages are displayed.
Several changes have been made to the package, specifically to the get_messages procedure.
SELECT TO_CHAR (nvl(MAX (RECEIVEDDATETIME),trunc(sysdate,'YYYY')), 'YYYY-MM-DD"T"HH24:MI:SS"Z"') into l_latest_messages FROM mail_messages;

http_request :=
            apex_web_service.make_rest_request (
                p_url           =>
                    'https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/#your_mail#/mailFolders/Inbox/messages?$select=id,receivedDateTime,hasAttachments,subject,bodyPreview,sender,from,importance&$filter=ReceivedDateTime%20gt%'||l_latest_messages,
                p_http_method   => 'GET',
                p_wallet_path   => 'your_wallet_path',
                p_wallet_pwd    => 'your_wallet_password');


It is possible to add other various filters to p_url, which you can find at the link: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/filter-query-parameter?tabs=http
Important: make sure that the url does not contain gaps, in the place where there is a gap, put %20 (you can see in my example)
